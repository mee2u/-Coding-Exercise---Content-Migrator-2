	<h3>	<div class ="header"> About Dominion Hospital</div></h3> 
<p>
<p>Dominion Hospital, the only freestanding mental health care facility in Northern Virginia leads the <br/>
region in short-term mental health services for children age 5-12, adolescents age 13-17 <br/>
and adults age 18 and older, as well as therapeutic programs for eating disorders through <br/>
our Reflections Eating Disorders Treatment Center.</p>




<h3>	Experienced. Comprehensive. Professional	</h3>


<p>We collaborate with experienced clinicians who excel in identifying symptoms, developing <br/>
comprehensive treatment plans and delivering effective clinical care. Our inpatient programs <br/>
provide 24-hour nursing care with full psychiatric services, while our Partial Programs offer a <br/>
highly structured environment during the day for participants who can return to their homes at <br/>
night.</p>

<p>Always attuned to the needs of our community, we blend the benefits of a safe and secure <br/>
treatment environment and an easily accessible suburban location with the top-quality <br/>
professional expertise that only the most skilled and best-trained mental health, medical and <br/>
support staff can deliver.</p>



<h3>Charity Care & Financial Discount Policy</h3>

<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to service, we work hard to help patients address their <br/>
financial responsibilities in a way that's fair and sensitive to their circumstances. Find more <br/>
information on our <u>charity care and financial discount policy</u>. </p>

<h3>Caring for Our Community</h3 >

<p>We're in your neighborhood, we care about your health and we take an active role in
 <u>caring for <br/>the communities we serve</u>. In addition to providing outstanding mental health <br/>services to our patients, we sponsor many health awareness events each year and
  <br/>contribute to the region's vibrant economy.</p>
  <h3>Donations & Volunteering </h3>

<p>We always appreciate your support and concern for individuals and families affected by <br/>
emotional, behavioral and mental health conditions. Because the safety, security and well-being <br/>
of our patients, clinicians and community are paramount, we're not able to accept donations <br/>
or offer volunteer opportunities at Dominion Hospital.</p>
